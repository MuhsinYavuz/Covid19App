COVID-19 TRACKING APPLICATION
THE APP HAS THREE INTERFACES:
1- MAIN SCREEN: This screen displays the list of countries in alphabetical order.
Users can choose each country by typing in the name into the search bar for
easy access. Pulling down the screen automatically refreshes the entire page.
Each line displays the name of the country as well as the number of daily
confirmed tests, cases and death toll.
2- DETAIL SCREEN: This screen shows extended statistical data on related cases.
The button on the top-right of the screen allows users to share all the
information on the page as text on every social networking platform.
3- HISTORY SCREEN: This screen is accessible from the button placed at the
bottom of the Detail Screen. On this page, users can find the links to statistical
data sequenced from the most recent by date for the relevant country. Clicking
on each link presents the statistical information for the preferred date back on
the Detail Screen.
The app must be coded using the Kotlin language along with the MVVM
Architecture. The app must also support both Turkish and English languages.
Using Unit test will be an addition.
